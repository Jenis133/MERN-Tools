# Day 1

    What is front-end, back-end and database?
    What is MERN?

# DAY 2

JS is a single-threaded (executing once at a time) synchronous language.
Commented code will not run.

Datatype:
There are three data types - number, string & boolean
Strings are always wrapped by ("").
Boolean are true or false values.

(;) are not particularly required in Javascript to declare a statement closing.

Operators:
1 + 1 = 2
"1" + "1" = "11"
"1" + 1 = "11" string takes priority over number

In js operations are performed between two values.

# Day 3

Variable:
A variable is a container that stores any data. It acts according to the value it contains.
We must define variable before calling it (variable)

Variable name must be descriptive. So try not to use a or b instead use num1 and num2.
Also pay attention to naming conventions.
$ and \_ can be used other than alphabets and numbers. However, numbers cannot be used at the start of a variable name.
Follow camelcase convention. He is married would be heIsMarried.

Error:
address is not defined => it means address variable is not defined
Else "ReferenceError: me is not defined" error will be displayed

JS is a dynamic language because a variable can store different data types at different time.
However in a static or strongly typed language like Java you can only store a different value for a data type but cannot change
the data type itself.

String:
It can be defined by using single quotes ('') or double quotes ("")
We cannot use single quotes inside single quotes and same for double quotes

# Day 4:

Undefined:
Undefined is a data type that is not initialized. It means a value is not assigned after a variable is defined.

Import & Export:
A variable can only be called within its file by default.
To call it in another file you will have to use export and import keyword
Use export keyword for the variable in the file you are exporting from
Use ctrl + space key to add the import keyword to the file you are importing in.

    Export by variable name:
        A file has many export by variable name
        It needs ({}) while importing the variable
        While importing you should use the exact variable name to avoid error

    Export by default:
        A file has only one export by default
        It does need ({}) while importing the variable
        While importing you can change the default variable name to avoid conflict

    Import by alias:
        If two variables of some name from different source are imported you should use alias
        To use alias you simply assign a name to the variable right next to it in import statement
            /* Example: import {Sid as Siddhartha} from "./sid.mjs;
                        console.log (Siddhartha); */

Conversion:
"1234" will be displayed as 1234 on the terminal.
Only a number string can be converted to a number and vice versa. Example: 1 !== a

    Boolean conversion:
        All empty are falsy values i.e either "" or 0.

        for boolean to string conversion
            "" => falsy
            all are truthy

        for boolean to number conversion
            0 => falsy
            all are truthy

Useful shortcut = Alt + Shift + A to comment multiple lines.

String Literals:
String can be defined using a ('') or ("") or (`).
    However we can not use a ('') inside a ('').
    Use ${variable} to call a variable inside a string using (`).
However this is not possible with a ("") or a ('').
However this is not possible with a ("") or a ('').

# Day 5:

    Nested Loop
    Functions

#Day 6:
Functions:
Every curly braces is like a new file.
We can define variable, call variable and so on.
But, we cannot export variable defined inside curly braces.

#Day 7:
Key Note:
Press alt + shift + down arrow to duplicate a statement in the next line
Select a common word and press Ctrl + D to select the remaining common words.

#Day 8:
The number of codes, number of lines and number of variables must be as less as possible.
They must satisfy the programming logic with necessary codes only.

check map, filter and reduce in array. // important
check for, while and do-while.

#Day 9:
Map in loop

F2 is to rename a file.

#Day 10:
Find method
Every, Filter, Map & Some can only be used in Array.

#Day 11: Class on 11:30 am

Interview Questions:
Define js -
truthy and falsy values -

#Day 13:
Ctrl + . = Spelling Suggestions
// import and export are not supported in .js extension

#Day 15:
// Try to make code as less as possible
// If there's only one line of code within a scope of an ifElse function then there's no need to write it inside ({})

Map & Filter:
Map is used to modify element of input whereas Filter is used to filter element of input
If you want to modify a value then use map but if you want to filter a value then use filter
If you have to use filter and map together then use filter first and then map

#Day 16:
Git push process:

git init
Make connection by copy paste:
	git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/nitanthapa425/dw-11-express.git
git add .
git commit -m "test" // add message in ""
git push origin master // branch is master
Click on the large noticeable link out of the two
enter your gitlab username
enter your gitlab password
Click on yes to go to gitlab
click on merge branch
click on merge again
